{"name":"Artisan","tagline":"An object testing library for python. The goal is to mimic the functionality of Ruby's 'machinist' library.","body":"### Artisan Testing\r\n\r\n#### Installing Artisan\r\nInstalling is nice and simple. It is available in PyPI.\r\n\r\n    pip install artisan\r\n\r\nIf you are not using a virtualenv, you probably will want to add the '--user' flag. However, you will also probably want to *start* using virtualenvs. Seriously, they're awesome.\r\n\r\n#### Using Artisan\r\nLet's assume there is a simple app you need to test with the Foo class. The Foo class looks a lot like:\r\n\r\n    class Foo(object):\r\n        ''' This is a simple object '''\r\n    \r\n        def __init__(self):\r\n            self.name = None\r\n\r\nBefore you can use artisan, you need to setup blueprints. Blueprints are simply dictionaries that contain lambdas used to generate the random data. In my example, I use the great [python-faker](https://github.com/redneckbeard/python-faker) library (it is available on PyPI, but I find the git repo is far more current).\r\n\r\nIn 'blueprints.py':\r\n\r\n    import faker\r\n    \r\n    Foo = {\r\n      'name': lambda: faker.name.name(),\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn your tests, you then do:\r\n\r\n    import blueprints\r\n    import artisan\r\n    \r\n    artisan.prepare(blueprints)\r\n    \r\n    artisan.craft(Foo)                # Creates an instance of the Foo class with a randomly generated name\r\n    artisan.craft(Foo, name='BarBaz') # Creates an instance of the Foo class with the name BarBaz\r\n\r\n### A Complete Example\r\n\r\n    Python 3.3.0 (default, Mar 13 2013, 18:04:53) \r\n    [GCC 4.2.1 20070719 ] on openbsd5\r\n    Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n    >>> import blueprints\r\n    >>> import artisan\r\n    >>> \r\n    >>> class Foo(object):\r\n    ...     def __init__(self):\r\n    ...         self.name = None\r\n    ... \r\n    >>> \r\n    >>> artisan.prepare(blueprints)\r\n    >>> artisan.craft(Foo).name\r\n    'Mrs. Savion Kuhn'\r\n    >>> artisan.craft(Foo).name\r\n    'Ms. Pearlie Collier'\r\n    >>> type(artisan.craft(Foo))    \r\n    <class '__main__.Foo'>\r\n\r\n### Miscellaneous\r\nI've been trying to keep artisan Python3 and Python2.X compatible. Also, Artisan in no way replaces your testing library, but helps to craft better data to test with. There are a number of improvements I'd like to integrate as well:\r\n\r\n * I want to make the use of blueprints an optional component. Given a class to create, it would be cool to do introspection and determine the attributes to generate information for.\r\n * I want abstract calls to python-faker behind a fabricate submodule to make it easier for developers to use, namely not having to write out lambdas. Although lambdas are a fantastic tool, and incredibly powerful, not everyone knows them and we're supposed to target the '90% Use Case'.\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\nArtisan is very much a Work In Progress. It will likely change. I am more than happy to accept Pull Requests, complaints, or general criticisms.
